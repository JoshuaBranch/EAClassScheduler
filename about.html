            Hello, My name is Joshua Branch and I am a senior at Explore Academy. I have attended this school since 9th grade. During my time at the school, I have been part of the National Honnor Society from 9th grade through my senior year. During 10th grade, I was the Vice-President of the student council where I helped with creating different tasks and other ways to help our school. 
            <br> <br>
            My current goals after highschool is to go to college and obtain a degree in comptuer science or game development. Another goal of mine is to start a business once I graduate from college.

            During my Senior year, I helped create the current <a class="aboutBodyLink" href="https://sites.google.com/view/eaclubs2/home">club page</a> for the school. The current project I am working on for the school is a student class scheduler. The reason why I decided to create this as my senior capstone project is for multiple reasons. The first reason is because of personal expierence. Building your own schedule is hard. Especially from the many different course options we have here at Explrore Academy. I was spending hours scheduling my classes for different terms and I wanted there to be an easier soultion. The next reason why is I know many peoople don't create their own class schedule which is not a good choice as there are many great choices to choose from. This is the reason why I decided to create this project. I wanted to let students easly create their class schedule with classes they want to take (or need to take) and schedule it with ease.
